# Shadowplay Theatre

A simple light to be used for the shadowplay as well as a simple little flashlight for kids. 

## Controls

- pressing any button starts the light in a white mode at low power
- then two buttons can be used for for power up/down
- one button flips through the white modes ()

## TODO

- rainbow speed is not nice
- the HSV conversion seems a bit off?
- candle & strobe effects
